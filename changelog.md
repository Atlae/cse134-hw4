# Changes

I filled in the Math-CS degree requirements on my website because it was empty before, and I suspect that is why I lost points in the previous assignment. I have also filled in the class descriptions as well, because to others, the numbers assigned corresponding to each class don't mean anything. I also added a link to my GitHub repository, so that people can see the source code for my website. I also added a script for the mobile view of my website, so that the navigation bar is hidden by default, and can be shown by clicking on the hamburger icon.

I also added a Google Analytics tracking script to my website, so I can see how many people visit my portfolio website and how they interact with it, so I can change it if necessary.
